# About iCaptch #
This project is meant to be simple yet powerful enough to withstand most of the spam bots and other automated attacks. First of all let me say that this project meets Image and Script Security requirements for CAPTCHA with this said why to reinvent the wheel, because I wanted additional functionality, Internalization, customization, but most importantly web service/web site independence and my goal was to create appealing rather than commonly seen distorted / gradient images.

Take a look at the generated captcha in the donwload section.
