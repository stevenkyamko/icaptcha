= Introduction =

Brief description on how I have implemented internalization in this project, how can end user extend and provide their own language files.

Currently iCAPTCHA comes with two default WordProducers [FactoryLanguageImpl, FactoryRandomImpl] any one can  create new WordProducer by extending 'abstract class IWordFactory' and then calling it using following syntax;
{{{
MyWordProducerImpl inst=(MyWordProducerImpl)Producer.forName("org.me.MyWordProducerImpl");
}}}
I have choosen to use abstract class instead of Interface because I wanted to provide so 
default implementation for some of the methods so that the person extending/ implementing it wouldn't have to worry about everything.





= Language file definitions.=

Each language pack consist of *two* files

  * .dic
  * .aff

===Example set===
languagefile.dic languagefile.aff

The *.aff* file contains one line indicating the encoding used itn the *.dic* file,
if *.aff* file is not present default enconding will be assumed _ISO8859-1_
Format for the *.dic* files is simple one word per line
===Example set===
{{{
wordA
wordB
wordC
}}}



=Redistributable Languages=
    * English -ISO8859-1
    * Polish - ISO8859-2
    * Russian - KOI8-R
    * German - ISO8859-1

Language files were downloaded from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:3 and are governed by they license agreement, this files have been slightly modified by me.
